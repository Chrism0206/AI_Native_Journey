# AI Native Journey ðŸš€

A comprehensive repository documenting my journey in building AI-native applications and exploring the frontiers of artificial intelligence development.

## Description

This repository serves as a living documentation of my exploration and implementation of AI-native development concepts. It focuses on practical applications of large language models (LLMs), advanced AI orchestration, and building intelligent, agentic systems that leverage the full potential of modern AI capabilities.

## Key Concepts / Topics Covered

- **LLM Orchestration**
  - Prompt engineering and optimization
  - Model chaining and composition
  - Context management and token optimization

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Vector databases and embeddings
  - Document processing and chunking
  - Semantic search implementation
  - Context retrieval strategies

- **Agentic Workflows**
  - Autonomous agent design
  - Tool use and function calling
  - Multi-agent systems
  - Decision-making frameworks

- **AI-First User Experiences**
  - Natural language interfaces
  - Conversational AI design
  - Adaptive user interactions
  - Context-aware applications

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**
  - Python
  - JavaScript/TypeScript
  - SQL

- **AI/ML Frameworks**
  - LangChain
  - OpenAI API
  - Hugging Face Transformers
  - Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.)

- **Development Tools**
  - Git
  - Docker
  - VS Code
  - Jupyter Notebooks

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI_Native_Journey.git
   cd AI_Native_Journey
   ```

2. Set up your development environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

4. Start exploring the projects and documentation!
