## üìñ About This Project

Caffeine Compass is an intelligent coffee recommendation system that combines the art of coffee appreciation with modern AI algorithms. Born from a passion for helping coffee enthusiasts discover their perfect brew, this project transforms complex coffee characteristics into personalized recommendations through an intuitive, interactive experience.

**Key Highlights:**
- **AI-Powered Matching**: Sophisticated algorithm that analyzes multiple preference dimensions
- **Comprehensive Database**: Curated collection of premium coffee beans from around the world
- **Interactive Experience**: Multi-step "Build Your Brew" flow for engaging user interaction
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with vanilla JavaScript and modern web standards
- **Responsive Design**: Beautiful, accessible interface that works on all devices

## üß† How It Works

### Core AI-Generated Logic

The recommendation engine uses a sophisticated scoring algorithm that analyzes multiple dimensions of coffee preferences:

#### 1. **Preference Analysis System**
```javascript
// Multi-dimensional scoring algorithm
- Roast Level Compatibility (30 points)
- Flavor Profile Matching (20 points per match)
- Acidity Level Alignment (25 points)
- Body Preference Matching (20 points)
- Origin Preference Bonus (15 points)
- Base Quality Rating (2x multiplier)
```

#### 2. **Intelligent Matching Algorithm**
The system employs a weighted scoring approach where:
- **Exact matches** receive full points
- **Compatible matches** receive partial points (e.g., Medium-Dark works with Dark)
- **Flavor combinations** are analyzed for synergistic effects
- **Origin preferences** provide regional bonuses
- **Quality ratings** ensure recommendations meet high standards

#### 3. **Dynamic Recommendation Engine**
- **Real-time Processing**: Analyzes preferences instantly without external API calls
- **Contextual Scoring**: Considers how different attributes interact
- **Personalization**: Adapts recommendations based on user interaction patterns
- **Fallback Logic**: Ensures recommendations even with minimal preference data

#### 4. **Data Structure Architecture**
The system uses a **list of dictionaries** approach for optimal performance:
```javascript
coffeeDatabase = [
  {
    name: "Ethiopian Yirgacheffe",
    roast: "Light",
    flavors: ["Fruity", "Floral", "Citrus"],
    acidity: "High",
    body: "Medium",
    origin: "Ethiopia",
    rating: 4.8,
    description: "Bright, floral, citrus notes..."
  }
  // ... more coffee entries
]
```

#### 5. **User Experience Flow**
1. **Preference Collection**: Interactive 3-step "Build Your Brew" process
2. **Data Processing**: Real-time preference analysis and scoring
3. **Recommendation Generation**: Top matches with detailed explanations
4. **Result Presentation**: Beautiful, informative display with ratings and descriptions
